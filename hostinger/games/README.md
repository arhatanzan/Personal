## Games

| S.No. | Game Title | Game Type | Difficulty | Description | Problem | Key Learning | Outcome | Need | How to Win / Goal |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Civic Feed | Simulation | Medium | You control a social media algorithm. Decide whether to boost content (amplifying it) or bury it (suppressing it). | We blindly trust feeds that are optimized for profit, not truth. | Algorithms naturally prioritize emotion. Anger drives higher engagement than facts. | Spotting 'rage-bait' and avoiding engagement traps. | Citizens need to understand how their attention is monetized. | Maintain high Public Info (>60%) while keeping Polarization low (<40%) before the turns run out. |
| 2 | Coalition Builder | Strategy | High | Negotiate with 4 rival political parties to secure 272 seats in a fractured parliament. | Voters often struggle to understand messy post-election compromises and alliances. | Ideological purity often dies in coalition math. Power requires trade-offs. | Understanding government instability and the necessity of political alliances. | Demystifying why politicians make seemingly contradictory alliances after elections. | Secure 251+ seats (votes) to pass 5 Laws within 10 Weeks without running out of Political Capital. |
| 3 | The News Desk | Management | Medium | You have 15 seconds to curate the 9 PM news. Pick stories (Scandals vs. Policy) to fill 5 broadcast slots. | Media businesses rely on capturing attention to survive, often at the cost of quality. | The 'Attention Economy' forces sensationalism over substance. | Critical consumption of news headlines; questioning why stories are chosen. | Understanding the commercial pressures behind editorial choices. | Keep both Ratings (Profit) and Civic Info (Duty) above zero for 5 full hours (rounds). |
| 4 | Budget Battle | Puzzle | Low | You have ₹100 Cr, but the city demands ₹160 Cr. Allocate funds across 5 angry sectors (Roads, Schools, etc.). | Citizens demand world-class services but often ignore the fiscal limits required to fund them. | Budgeting is a zero-sum game. Every 'Yes' to one sector forces a 'No' to another. | Understanding policy trade-offs and populist pressure on representatives. | Realizing that "efficiency" isn't magic; resources are finite and require hard choices. | Achieve a Re-election Approval rating of 60%+ without being exposed for corruption (if you took bribes). |
| 5 | The Whisper Campaign | Simulation | High | Map how rumors infect a community. Attempt to hijack an election by planting info in specific groups (Nodes). | Disinformation thrives in insulated echo chambers where outside facts cannot penetrate. | How information bubbles insulate voters from reality. | Inoculation against network-based propaganda. | Recognizing that misinformation is often engineered to exploit social fault lines. | Flip the District Support to 60%+ (or higher for Dictatorship) within 14 Days using limited Influence. |
