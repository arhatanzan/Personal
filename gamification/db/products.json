    "description": "You control a social media algorithm. For each turn, decide which posts to boost and which to bury as citizens scroll their feeds.\n\nProblem: We blindly trust feeds that are optimized for profit, not truth.\nKey Learning: Algorithms naturally prioritize emotional content, especially anger, because it drives engagement more than nuanced facts.\nOutcome: Players practice spotting 'rage-bait' and engagement traps.\nNeed: Citizens need to understand how their attention is monetized and weaponized.\nGoal: Maintain high Public Info (>60%) while keeping Polarization low (<40%) before the turns run out.",
